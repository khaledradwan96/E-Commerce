# 🛒 E-Commerce Website

This is a simple e-commerce website built as a **graduation project** form NCW - Front-end course by Sprints. 
I use only **HTML**, **CSS**, **Vanilla JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap 5**.  
It allows users to browse products, register, log in, and manage a shopping cart using `localStorage`.
